# Super Store Sales Dashboard

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Super Store Sales Dashboard** project, a dynamic platform that brings together sales data from various categories, regions, and periods to provide a holistic view of our superstore's performance. Based on my analysis, I found various visualizations and data insights created using Power BI Desktop for sales and profit data.

## Key Insights:
### 1) Sales Breakdown by Category:

* The document displays sales data categorized into three main categories: Office Supplies, Technology, and Furniture.
* Sales amounts are presented in millions (e.g., 0.64M for Office Supplies).
  
### 2) Sales Breakdown by Ship Mode:

* Sales data is segmented by different shipping modes, such as Standard, Second Class, First Class, and Same Day.
### 3) Sales Breakdown by Sub-Category:

* Sales data is further broken down into sub-categories like Phones, Chairs, and Binders.
### 4) Monthly Sales and Profit Trends:

* There are visualizations representing monthly sales and profit data for different years (2019 and 2020).
* It seems that there is no data (0.0M) for January and possibly other months in the "Monthly Sales by YoY" section.

### 5) A sum of Profit and Sales by State:

* Data regarding the sum of profit and sales by state is presented, with states like California, New York, and Texas mentioned.
### 6) Sales by Segment:

* Sales data is segmented into categories, with percentages mentioned (e.g., Corporate, Home Office).
